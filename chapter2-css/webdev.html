        Contrary to popular 
        
        , Lorem Ipsum is not si
        mply random text. It has roots 
               
        in a piece of classical Latin literatu
        re from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
         Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampd
         en-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of 
         the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lo
         rem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the w
         ord in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable sou
         rce. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de F
         inibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by 
         Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory 
         of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lo
         rem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor
         sit amet..", comes from
          a line in section 1.10
          .32.
